MANY THANKS TO DR JONES FOR CREATING THIS MOD! BIG SHOUTOUT TO SUMRAK FOR NAMALSK! Namalsk Trader Base created by scalespeeder. See https://www.youtube.com/ScalespeederGaming

YOU MUST HAVE DR JONES TRADER & NAMALSK (ISLAND / SURVIVAL) INSTALLED AND WORKING FOR THIS FILE TO WORK!

REMEMBER TO ADD THE TRADER ITEMS TO YOUR NAMALSK TYPES.XML! SEE https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1590841260

UNLESS YOU ADD THE NAMALSK SPECIFIC ITEMS TO YOUR TraderConfig.txt (LOCATED IN YOUR TRADER CONFIG FOLDER INSIDER YOUR SERVER PROFILE / CONFIG FOLDER,
THE TRADERS WILL ONLY HAVE VANILLA DAYZ ITEMS.

To download the files, click on the Green "Code" button, then "Download" and unzip the files to your local PC drive.

To spawn a Trader Base in at 6324.60 / 9479.86, On The Namalask Airfield, simply upload the supplied TraderObjects.txt file to the Trader Config folder,
which is inside your servers Profile / Config folder, over the top of the existing TraderObjects file. (Make a copy of the original for if you want to swap
back to a Chernrus Server, or another map.)

Also included is a NAMALSK-TRADER.dze file, which can be loaded into the DayZ Editor Mod, and if you open the file in the Namalsk map,
you could use it as a basis to customise the Trader Base to your own liking (although you will need to be familiar with how to edit the TraderObject.txt file,
and those instructions are not included here.) Also note that the truck wreck inside the code is purely a reference for the spawn point of purchased vehicles.

Restart your server and the Trader will spawn in.
